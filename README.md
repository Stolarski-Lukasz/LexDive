# LexDive

LexDive is a free program for calculating lexical diversity of English texts. Its functionality is divided into three parts:

1. File View - the user should first paste text or load a text file for analysis.

2. Text Statistics - this tool makes it possible for the user to count tokens, types, and lemmas in the text.

3. Lexical Diversity - the main functionality of the program. The user can choose from several lexical diversity indices. In many cases, additional text sampling options are available.

LexDive is available for free at [lexdive.pythonanywhere.com](https://lexdive.pythonanywhere.com).
